# Music-Player

In this C program I just make something to learn C language.
And how to use git with github and push files / folders.
This C code is to play music that i have push them in Library/Music only.
It check's if the Library is available.
If it is not available than you have to download the Library,
or you can make a folder could Library/Music/ then put all the songs that you have.
Make sure thet you are using termux because all the code is for termux.
And make sure that this is the path of all the project 
(/data/data/com.termux/files/home/MyTasks/)
You can edit the code and run it in linux system.
